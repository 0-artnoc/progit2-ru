=== The API

(((GitHub, API)))
If the web UI isn't enough for you, or you're writing a program that works with GitHub projects, you'll be happy to know that GitHub has an API.
It works over HTTPS, so it's fairly easy to try out:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl https://api.github.com/user/schacon
{
  "login": "schacon",
  "id": 70,
  "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70?",
# â€¦
  "following": 19,
  "created_at": "2008-01-27T17:19:28Z",
  "updated_at": "2014-06-10T02:37:23Z"
}
----

Most everything you can do from the GitHub web interface or from Git itself can be done through this API, as well as some things that can't.
Remember how `gh` can convert an issue into a pull request?
That's accomplished using the a `POST` to the `/repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls` endpoint.

Several open-source libraries exist that make this API available in an idiomatic way.
At the time of this writing, the supported languages include Go, Objective-C, Ruby, and .NET.
Check out http://github.com/octokit[] for more information on these, as they handle much of the HTTP for you.

There's much more to the API than is possible to cover in this book.
Take a look at https://developer.github.com[] for the complete documentation, as well as guides for common tasks.
