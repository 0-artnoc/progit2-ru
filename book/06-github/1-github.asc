== GitHub

(((GitHub)))
GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories, and is the central point of collaboration for millions of developers and projects.
A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub, and many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code review, and other things.
So while it's not a direct part of the Git open source project, there's a good chance that you'll want to interact with GitHub at some point while using Git.

This chapter is about using GitHub effectively.
We'll cover signing up for and managing an account, creating and using Git repositories, common workflows, interacting with projects, lots of little tips to make your life easier, and GitHub's programmatic interface.

If you are not interested in using GitHub to host your own projects or to collaborate with other projects that are hosted on GitHub, you can safely skip to the <<_git_tools, next chapter>>.
