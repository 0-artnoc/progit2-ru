= Pro Git, Second Edition

Welcome to the second edition of the Pro Git book.  Until release, this README will be notes on how to collaboratively write this book.

First, each chapter will have to be converted from the Markdown of the first release to Asciidoc for the generation toolchain.

We should put each topic we want to address in as an issue and close the issue when the text addressing it is complete.  That way we can see what still needs to be done, who is assigned to what and have conversations around the topics before writing.

We will use the Pull Request workflow to collaborate on the book.  Referencing an existing issue or multiple issues from the PR is encouraged.  Ideally the technical editor will sign off on each PR as well and should be opening their own as we go.

I will start by putting in the outline of the current book as OUTLINE.asc and we can start by figuring out what we want the skeleton of the second edition to look like.

== Git 2.0

The book should be aimed at releasing close to Git 2.0 and all of the examples and defaults should be tuned to what Git 2.0 will act and look like.
